## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Transactions</code></p>

<pre>
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.   
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find all&nbsp;<code>customer_id</code>&nbsp;who made the maximum number of transactions on consecutive days.</p>

<p>Return all <code>customer_id</code>&nbsp;with the maximum number of consecutive transactions.&nbsp;Order the result table by&nbsp;<code>customer_id</code> in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Transactions table:
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | transaction_date | amount |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| 1              | 101         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 2              | 101         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 3              | 101         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
| 4              | 102         | 2023-05-01       | 50     |
| 5              | 102         | 2023-05-03       | 100    |
| 6              | 102         | 2023-05-04       | 200    |
| 7              | 105         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 8              | 105         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 9              | 105         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------------+
| customer_id | 
+-------------+
| 101         | 
| 105         | 
+-------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- customer_id 101 has a total of 3 transactions, and all of them are consecutive.
- customer_id 102 has a total of 3 transactions, but only 2 of them are consecutive. 
- customer_id 105 has a total of 3 transactions, and all of them are consecutive.
In total, the highest number of consecutive transactions is 3, achieved by customer_id 101 and 105. The customer_id are sorted in ascending order.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    s AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            DATE_SUB(
                transaction_date,
                INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY customer_id
                    ORDER BY transaction_date
                ) DAY
            ) AS transaction_date
        FROM Transactions
    ),
    t AS (
        SELECT customer_id, transaction_date, COUNT(1) AS cnt
        FROM s
        GROUP BY 1, 2
    )
SELECT customer_id
FROM t
WHERE cnt = (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM t)
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
