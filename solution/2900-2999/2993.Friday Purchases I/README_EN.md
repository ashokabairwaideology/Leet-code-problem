## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Date Functions

The date functions we use include:

-   `DATE_FORMAT(date, format)`: Formats a date as a string
-   `DAYOFWEEK(date)`: Returns the day of the week for a date, where 1 represents Sunday, 2 represents Monday, and so on
-   `DAYOFMONTH(date)`: Returns the day of the month for a date

First, we use the `DATE_FORMAT` function to format the date in the form of `YYYYMM`, then filter out the records of November 2023 that fall on a Friday. Next, we group the records by `purchase_date` and calculate the total consumption amount for each Friday.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    CEIL(DAYOFMONTH(purchase_date) / 7) AS week_of_month,
    purchase_date,
    SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
FROM Purchases
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(purchase_date, '%Y%m') = '202311' AND DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1;
```
