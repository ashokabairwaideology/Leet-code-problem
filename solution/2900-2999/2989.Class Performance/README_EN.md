+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |
| assignment1  | int     |
| assignment2  | int     |
| assignment3  | int     |
+--------------+---------+
student_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains student_id, student_name, assignment1, assignment2, and assignment3.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to calculate the <strong>difference</strong> in the <strong>total score</strong> (sum of all <code>3</code> assignments) between the <strong>highest score</strong> obtained by students and the <strong>lowest score</strong> obtained by them.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table in <strong>any</strong> order</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Output</strong>
+---------------------+
| difference_in_score | 
+---------------------+
| 111                 | 
+---------------------+
<strong>Explanation</strong>
- student_id 309 has a total score of 88 + 47 + 87 = 222.
- student_id 321 has a total score of 98 + 95 + 37 = 230.
- student_id 338 has a total score of 100 + 64 + 43 = 207.
- student_id 423 has a total score of 60 + 44 + 47 = 151.
- student_id 896 has a total score of 32 + 37 + 50 = 119.
- student_id 235 has a total score of 31 + 53 + 69 = 153.
student_id 321 has the highest score of 230, while student_id 896 has the lowest score of 119. Therefore, the difference between them is 111.

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Maximum and Minimum

We can use the `MAX` and `MIN` functions to get the maximum and minimum sums of `assignment1`, `assignment2`, and `assignment3`, respectively. Then, subtract the minimum from the maximum.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    MAX(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3) - MIN(
        assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3
    ) AS difference_in_score
FROM Scores;
```
