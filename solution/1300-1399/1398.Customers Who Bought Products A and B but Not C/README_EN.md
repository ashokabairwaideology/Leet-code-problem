## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING

We can use `LEFT JOIN` to join the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table, then group them by `customer_id`, and finally filter out the customers who have purchased products A and B but not product C.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM
    Customers
    LEFT JOIN Orders USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(product_name = 'A') > 0 AND SUM(product_name = 'B') > 0 AND SUM(product_name = 'C') = 0
ORDER BY 1;
```
