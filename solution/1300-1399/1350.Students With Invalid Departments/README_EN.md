## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Subquery

We can directly use a subquery to find all students who are not in the `Departments` table.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT id, name
FROM Students
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Departments);
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

<!-- solution:end -->

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 2: Left Join

We can also use a left join to join the `Students` table with the `Departments` table on the condition of `Students.department_id = Departments.id`, and then filter out the students whose `Departments.id` is `NULL`.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM
    Students AS s
    LEFT JOIN Departments AS d ON s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NULL;
```
