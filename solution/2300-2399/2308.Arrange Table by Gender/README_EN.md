## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Genders</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| gender      | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
gender is ENUM (category) of type &#39;female&#39;, &#39;male&#39;, or &#39;other&#39;.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a user and their gender.
The table has an equal number of &#39;female&#39;, &#39;male&#39;, and &#39;other&#39;.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution&nbsp;to rearrange the <code>Genders</code> table such that the rows alternate between <code>&#39;female&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;other&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;male&#39;</code> in order. The table should be rearranged such that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>the mentioned order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is shown in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Genders table:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 3       | female |
| 8       | male   |
| 6       | other  |
| 1       | other  |
| 9       | female |
+---------+--------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 3       | female |
| 1       | other  |
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 9       | female |
| 6       | other  |
| 8       | male   |
+---------+--------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Female gender: IDs 3, 7, and 9.
Other gender: IDs 1, 2, and 6.
Male gender: IDs 4, 5, and 8.
We arrange the table alternating between &#39;female&#39;, &#39;other&#39;, and &#39;male&#39;.
Note that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.
