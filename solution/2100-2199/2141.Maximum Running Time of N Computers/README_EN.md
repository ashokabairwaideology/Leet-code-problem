## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You have <code>n</code> computers. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>batteries</code> where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> battery can <strong>run</strong> a computer for <code>batteries[i]</code> minutes. You are interested in running <strong>all</strong> <code>n</code> computers <strong>simultaneously</strong> using the given batteries.</p>

<p>Initially, you can insert <strong>at most one battery</strong> into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery <strong>any number of times</strong>. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.</p>

<p>Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of minutes you can run all the </em><code>n</code><em> computers simultaneously.</em></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.

<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Binary Search

We notice that if we can run $n$ computers simultaneously for $t$ minutes, then we can also run $n$ computers simultaneously for $t' \le t$ minutes, which shows monotonicity. Therefore, we can use the binary search method to find the maximum $t$.

We define the left boundary of the binary search as $l=0$ and the right boundary as $r=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} batteries[i]$. During each binary search iteration, we use a variable $mid$ to represent the current middle value, i.e., $mid = (l + r + 1) >> 1$. We check if there exists a scheme that allows $n$ computers to run simultaneously for $mid$ minutes. If such a scheme exists, then we update $l$ to $mid$; otherwise, we update $r$ to $mid - 1$. Finally, we return $l$ as the answer.

The problem is transformed into how to determine if there exists a scheme that allows $n$ computers to run simultaneously for $mid$ minutes. If a battery can run for more minutes than $mid$, since the computers run simultaneously for $mid$ minutes and a battery can only power one computer at a time, we can only use this battery for $mid$ minutes. If a battery can run for minutes less than or equal to $mid$, we can use all the power of this battery. Therefore, we calculate the total minutes $s$ that all batteries can power, and if $s \ge n \times mid$, then we can make $n$ computers run simultaneously for $mid$ minutes.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log M)$, where $M$ is the total power of all batteries, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maxRunTime(self, n: int, batteries: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, sum(batteries)
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r + 1) >> 1
            if sum(min(x, mid) for x in batteries) >= n * mid:
                l = mid
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return l
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public long maxRunTime(int n, int[] batteries) {
        long l = 0, r = 0;
        for (int x : batteries) {
            r += x;
        }
        while (l < r) {
            long mid = (l + r + 1) >> 1;
