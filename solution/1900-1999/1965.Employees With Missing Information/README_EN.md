## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Subquery + Union

We can first find all `employee_id` that are not in the `Salaries` table from the `Employees` table, and then find all `employee_id` that are not in the `Employees` table from the `Salaries` table. Finally, we can combine the two results using the `UNION` operator, and sort the result by `employee_id`.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries)
UNION
SELECT employee_id
FROM Salaries
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY 1;
```
