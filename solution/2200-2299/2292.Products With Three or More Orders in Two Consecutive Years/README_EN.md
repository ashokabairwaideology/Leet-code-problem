| order_id      | int  |
| product_id    | int  |
| quantity      | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
+---------------+------+
order_id contains unique values.
Each row in this table contains the ID of an order, the id of the product purchased, the quantity, and the purchase date.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to report the IDs of all the products that were ordered three or more times in two consecutive years.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is shown in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Orders table:
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
| order_id | product_id | quantity | purchase_date |
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 1          | 7        | 2020-03-16    |
| 2        | 1          | 4        | 2020-12-02    |
| 3        | 1          | 7        | 2020-05-10    |
| 4        | 1          | 6        | 2021-12-23    |
| 5        | 1          | 5        | 2021-05-21    |
| 6        | 1          | 6        | 2021-10-11    |
| 7        | 2          | 6        | 2022-10-11    |
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+------------+
| product_id |
+------------+
| 1          |
+------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Product 1 was ordered in 2020 three times and in 2021 three times. Since it was ordered three times in two consecutive years, we include it in the answer.
Product 2 was ordered one time in 2022. We do not include it in the answer.

        GROUP BY 1, 2
    )
SELECT DISTINCT p1.product_id
FROM
    P AS p1
    JOIN P AS p2 ON p1.y = p2.y - 1 AND p1.product_id = p2.product_id
WHERE p1.mark AND p2.mark;
