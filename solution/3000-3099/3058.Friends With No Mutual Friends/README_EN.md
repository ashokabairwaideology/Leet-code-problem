## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Friends</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id1    | int  |
| user_id2    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id1, user_id2) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains user id1, user id2, both of whom are friends with each other.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find <strong>all</strong> <strong>pairs</strong> of users who are friends with each other and have <strong>no mutual</strong> friends.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by </em><code>user_id1,</code> <code>user_id2</code><em> in <strong>ascending</strong></em><em><strong> </strong>order.</em></p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Friends table:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 | 
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        | 
| 2        | 3        | 
| 2        | 4        | 
| 1        | 5        | 
| 6        | 7        | 
| 3        | 4        | 
| 2        | 5        | 
| 8        | 9        | 
+----------+----------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 | 
+----------+----------+
| 6        | 7        | 
| 8        | 9        | 
+----------+----------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Users 1 and 2 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 5, so this pair is not included.
- Users 2 and 3 are friends, they both share a mutual friend with user ID 4, resulting in exclusion, similarly for users 2 and 4 who share a mutual friend with user ID 3, hence not included.
- Users 1 and 5 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 2, so this pair is not included.
- Users 6 and 7, as well as users 8 and 9, are friends with each other, and they don&#39;t have any mutual friends, hence included.
- Users 3 and 4 are friends with each other, but their mutual connection with user ID 2 means they are not included, similarly for users 2 and 5 are friends but are excluded due to their mutual connection with user ID 1.
Output table is ordered by user_id1 in ascending order.</pre>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Subquery

First, we list all the friend relationships and record them in table `T`. Then we find the pairs of friends who do not have common friends.

Next, we can use a subquery to find pairs of friends who do not have common friends, i.e., this pair of friends does not belong to any other person's friends.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT user_id1, user_id2 FROM Friends
        UNION ALL
        SELECT user_id2, user_id1 FROM Friends
    )
SELECT user_id1, user_id2
FROM Friends
WHERE
    (user_id1, user_id2) NOT IN (
        SELECT t1.user_id1, t2.user_id1
        FROM
            T AS t1
            JOIN T AS t2 ON t1.user_id2 = t2.user_id2
    )
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

#### Python3

```python
import pandas as pd


def friends_with_no_mutual_friends(friends: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    cp = friends.copy()
    t = cp[["user_id1", "user_id2"]].copy()
    t = pd.concat(
        [
            t,
            cp[["user_id2", "user_id1"]].rename(
                columns={"user_id2": "user_id1", "user_id1": "user_id2"}
            ),
        ]
    )
    merged = t.merge(t, left_on="user_id2", right_on="user_id2")
    ans = cp[
        ~cp.apply(
            lambda x: (x["user_id1"], x["user_id2"])
            in zip(merged["user_id1_x"], merged["user_id1_y"]),
            axis=1,
        )
    ]
    return ans.sort_values(by=["user_id1", "user_id2"])
```
