Customers table:
+-------------+------+---------+
| customer_id | year | revenue |
+-------------+------+---------+
| 1           | 2018 | 50      |

| 2           | 2021 | -50     |
| 3           | 2018 | 10      |
| 3           | 2016 | 50      |
| 4           | 2021 | 20      |

<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------------+
| customer_id |

+-------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Customer 1 has revenue equal to 30 in the year 2021.
Customer 2 has revenue equal to -50 in the year 2021.
Customer 3 has no revenue in the year 2021.
Customer 4 has revenue equal to 20 in the year 2021.
Thus only customers 1 and 4 have positive revenue in the year 2021.

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: WHERE Clause

We can directly use the `WHERE` clause to filter out the customers whose `year` is `2021` and `revenue` is greater than $0$.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    customer_id
FROM Customers
WHERE year = '2021' AND revenue > 0;
```
