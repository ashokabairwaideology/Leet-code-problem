## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>ParkingTransactions</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+-----------+
| Column Name  | Type      |
+--------------+-----------+
| lot_id       | int       |
| car_id       | int       |
| entry_time   | datetime  |
| exit_time    | datetime  |
| fee_paid     | decimal   |
+--------------+-----------+
(lot_id, car_id, entry_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of the parking lot, the ID of the car, the entry and exit times, and the fee paid for the parking duration.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find the <strong>total parking fee</strong> paid by each car <strong>across all parking lots</strong>, and the <strong>average hourly fee</strong> (rounded to <code>2</code> decimal places) paid by <strong>each</strong> car. Also, find the <strong>parking lot</strong> where each car spent the <strong>most total time</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by </em><code>car_id</code><em><b> </b>in<b> ascending </b></em><em> order.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Test cases are generated in such a way that an individual car cannot be in multiple parking lots at the same time.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>

<p>ParkingTransactions table:</p>

+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Grouping + Joining

We can first group by `car_id` and `lot_id` to calculate the parking duration for each car in each parking lot. Then, we use the `RANK()` function to rank the parking duration of each car in each parking lot to find the parking lot where each car has the longest parking duration.

Finally, we can group by `car_id` to calculate the total parking fee, average hourly fee, and the parking lot with the longest parking duration for each car.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            car_id,
            lot_id,
            SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, entry_time, exit_time)) AS duration
        FROM ParkingTransactions
        GROUP BY 1, 2
    ),
    P AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY car_id
                ORDER BY duration DESC
            ) AS rk
        FROM T
    )
SELECT
    t1.car_id,
    SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid,
    ROUND(
        SUM(fee_paid) / (SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, entry_time, exit_time)) / 3600),
        2
    ) AS avg_hourly_fee,
    t2.lot_id AS most_time_lot
FROM
    ParkingTransactions AS t1
    LEFT JOIN P AS t2 ON t1.car_id = t2.car_id AND t2.rk = 1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
