## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Purchases</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| user_id       | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
| amount_spend  | int  |
+---------------+------+
(user_id, purchase_date, amount_spend) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
purchase_date will range from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, inclusive of both dates.
Each row contains user_id, purchase_date, and amount_spend.
</pre>

<p>Table: <code>Users</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| membership  | enum |
+-------------+------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
membership is an ENUM (category) type of (&#39;Standard&#39;, &#39;Premium&#39;, &#39;VIP&#39;).
Each row of this table indicates the user_id, membership type.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to calculate the <strong>total spending</strong> by <code>Premium</code>&nbsp;and <code>VIP</code> members on <strong>each Friday of every week</strong> in November 2023.&nbsp; If there are <strong>no purchases</strong> on a <strong>particular Friday</strong> by <code>Premium</code> or <code>VIP</code> members, it should be considered as <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table</em>&nbsp;<em>ordered by week of the month,&nbsp; and </em><code>membership</code><em> in <strong>ascending</strong> order</em>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>During the first week of November 2023, a transaction occurred on Friday, 2023-11-03, by a Premium member amounting to $1,126. No transactions were made by VIP members on this day, resulting in a value of 0.</li>
	<li>For the second week of November 2023, there was a transaction on Friday, 2023-11-10, and it was made by a VIP member, amounting to $7,473. Since there were no purchases by Premium members that Friday, the output shows 0 for Premium members.</li>
	<li>Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, no transactions by Premium or VIP members occurred on Friday, 2023-11-17, which shows 0 for both categories in this week.</li>
	<li>In the fourth week of November 2023, transactions occurred on Friday, 2023-11-24, involving one Premium member purchase of $5,117 and VIP member purchases totaling $14,933 ($9,692 from one and $5,241 from another).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The output table is ordered by week_of_month and membership in ascending order.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Recursion + Join

First, we create a recursive table `T` that includes a `week_of_month` column, representing the week of the month. Then we create a table `M` that includes a `membership` column, representing the type of membership, with values `'Premium'` and `'VIP'`.

Next, we create a table `P` that includes `week_of_month`, `membership`, and `amount_spend` columns, filtering out the amount spent by each member on Fridays of each week of the month. Finally, we join tables `T` and `M`, then left join table `P`, and group by `week_of_month` and `membership` columns to calculate the total spending of each type of member each week.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH RECURSIVE
    T AS (
        SELECT 1 AS week_of_month
        UNION
        SELECT week_of_month + 1
        FROM T
        WHERE week_of_month < 4
    ),
    M AS (
        SELECT 'Premium' AS membership
        UNION
        SELECT 'VIP'
    ),
    P AS (
        SELECT CEIL(DAYOFMONTH(purchase_date) / 7) AS week_of_month, membership, amount_spend
        FROM
            Purchases
            JOIN Users USING (user_id)
        WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6
    )
SELECT week_of_month, membership, IFNULL(SUM(amount_spend), 0) AS total_amount
FROM
    T
    JOIN M
    LEFT JOIN P USING (week_of_month, membership)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```
