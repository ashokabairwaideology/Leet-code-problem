# [319. Bulb Switcher](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher)

[中文文档](/solution/0300-0399/0319.Bulb%20Switcher/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then&nbsp;you turn off every second bulb.</p>

<p>On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it&#39;s off or turning off if it&#39;s on). For the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> round, you toggle every <code>i</code> bulb. For the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> round, you only toggle the last bulb.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of bulbs that are on after <code>n</code> rounds</em>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 1

	<li><code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Mathematics

We can number the $n$ bulbs as $1, 2, 3, \cdots, n$. For the $i$-th bulb, it will be operated in the $d$-th round if and only if $d$ is a factor of $i$.

For a number $i$, the number of its factors is finite. If the number of factors is odd, the final state is on; otherwise, it is off.

Therefore, we only need to find the number of numbers from $1$ to $n$ with an odd number of factors.

For a number $i$, if it has a factor $d$, then it must have a factor $i/d$. Therefore, numbers with an odd number of factors must be perfect squares.

For example, the factors of the number $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$, and the number of factors is $6$, which is even. For the perfect square number $16$, the factors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$, and the number of factors is $5$, which is odd.

Therefore, we only need to find how many perfect squares there are from $1$ to $n$, which is $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$.

The time complexity is $O(1)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.
