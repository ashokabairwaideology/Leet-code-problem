# [1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ships-in-a-rectangle)

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](/solution/1200-1299/1274.Number%20of%20Ships%20in%20a%20Rectangle/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p><em>(This problem is an <strong>interactive problem</strong>.)</em></p>

<p>Each ship is located at an integer point on the sea represented by a cartesian plane, and each integer point may contain at most 1 ship.</p>

<p>You have a function <code>Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)</code> which takes two points as arguments and returns <code>true</code> If there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the boundary.</p>

<p>Given two points: the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle. It is guaranteed that there are <strong>at most 10 ships</strong> in that rectangle.</p>

<p>Submissions making <strong>more than 400 calls</strong> to <code>hasShips</code> will be judged <em>Wrong Answer</em>. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
ships = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[5,5]], topRight = [4,4], bottomLeft = [0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> From [0,0] to [4,4] we can count 3 ships within the range.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ans = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], topRight = [1000,1000], bottomLeft = [0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>On the input <code>ships</code> is only given to initialize the map internally. You must solve this problem &quot;blindfolded&quot;. In other words, you must find the answer using the given <code>hasShips</code> API, without knowing the <code>ships</code> position.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= bottomLeft[0] &lt;= topRight[0] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= bottomLeft[1] &lt;= topRight[1] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>topRight != bottomLeft</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Recursion + Divide and Conquer

Since there are at most $10$ ships in the rectangle, we can divide the rectangle into four sub-rectangles, calculate the number of ships in each sub-rectangle, and then add the number of ships in the four sub-rectangles. If there are no ships in a sub-rectangle, then there is no need to continue dividing.

The time complexity is $O(C \times \log \max(m, n))$, and the space complexity is $O(\log \max(m, n))$. Where $C$ is the number of ships, and $m$ and $n$ are the length and width of the rectangle, respectively.
